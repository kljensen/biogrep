ex4.pat contains a single regular expression that searches for lines that
contain contractions.  ex4.txt is the text "The Right to Read" by Richard
M. Stallman.  To print lines containing contractions in Stallman's text and
a single line after the matching line, use the command

prompt> biogrep -p ex4.pat -i ex4.txt -t -A1

The -t tells biogrep that the file is a plain text file and the -A1 tells it
to print one line after the matching line.
